A Fashion Recommendation System using Image Features leverages computer vision and machine learning techniques to analyze fashion itemsâ€™ visual aspects (like colour, texture, and style) and recommend similar or complementary products to users. So, if you want to learn how to build a Fashion Recommendation System by utilizing image features, this is for you.
Building a fashion recommendation system using image features involves several key steps, leveraging both computer vision and machine learning techniques. Below is a detailed process you can follow to build a fashion recommendation system using image features:

Assemble a diverse dataset of fashion items. This dataset should include a wide variety of items with different colours, patterns, styles, and categories.
Ensure all images are in a consistent format (e.g., JPEG, PNG) and resolution.
Implement a preprocessing function to prepare images for feature extraction.
Choose a pre-trained CNN model such as VGG16, ResNet, or InceptionV3. These models, pre-trained on large datasets like ImageNet, are capable of extracting powerful feature representations from images.
Pass each image through the CNN model to extract features.
Define a metric for measuring the similarity between feature vectors. 
Rank the dataset images based on their similarity to the input image and recommend the top N items that are most similar.
Implement a final function that encapsulates the entire process from pre-processing an input image, extracting features, computing similarities, and outputting recommendations.
